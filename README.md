Text Preprocessing Techniques for NLP
This repository contains a collection of text preprocessing techniques commonly used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. The goal of these preprocessing steps is to clean, normalize, and structure text data, making it suitable for various NLP applications such as text classification, sentiment analysis, and more.

Preprocessing Techniques Implemented
1. Text Lowercasing
Text lowercasing involves converting all characters in the text to lowercase. This step ensures uniformity and makes the text case-insensitive, which is beneficial for many NLP tasks.

2. Removing HTML Tags (Method 2: Regular Expression)
HTML tags are removed using regular expressions. This step is crucial for processing text that may contain HTML content, such as web page data or online articles.

3. Removing Punctuation Marks
Punctuation marks (ex.!"#$%&'()*+, -./:;<=>?@[]^_`{|}~) are removed to simplify the text and reduce noise that might interfere with NLP analysis.

4. Chat Word Treatment (Short Hand)
Chat words and shorthand expressions are treated, ensuring that they are converted to their full forms. This step helps in normalizing text and improving consistency.

5. Tokenization
Tokenization involves splitting text into individual words or tokens. This facilitates further analysis at the word level and is a fundamental step in NLP.

6. Stemming
Stemming reduces words to their base or root form. This process helps in simplifying vocabulary and can improve text consistency.

7. Lemmatization
Lemmatization is used to reduce words to their base or dictionary form, often producing more meaningful results than stemming. It is a more advanced technique that considers the context of the word.

Usage
Feel free to use these text preprocessing techniques in your NLP projects to enhance the quality of your text data before feeding it into machine learning models. You can choose the specific techniques that are relevant to your task and integrate them into your data preprocessing pipeline.
